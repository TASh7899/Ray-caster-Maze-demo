# Ray-caster-Maze-demo
This project is a 2.5D Raycaster built using Raylib and C++. It implements a basic first-person rendering engine similar to early games like Wolfenstein 3D. The raycaster simulates a 3D environment by casting rays from the player's viewpoint and rendering vertical walls based on distance calculations.
