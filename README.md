# Raycaster in Raylib

A simple **raycasting engine** built using **C++ and Raylib**, inspired by classic games like **Wolfenstein 3D**. This project demonstrates the **DDA algorithm** for rendering 3D-like environments using a 2D grid.

## ðŸŽ® Features
- **Raycasting Engine**: Uses the Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) algorithm for wall rendering.
- **Basic Movement**: Move forward, backward, and rotate the camera left/right.
- **Wall Collision Detection**: Prevents the player from passing through walls.
- **Textured Walls (Optional)**: Expandable to support wall textures.
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses **Raylib** for efficient rendering.
