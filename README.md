# Ray-caster-Maze-demo
This project is a 2.5D Raycaster built using Raylib and C++. It implements a basic first-person rendering engine similar to early games like Wolfenstein 3D. The raycaster simulates a 3D environment by casting rays from the player's viewpoint and rendering vertical walls based on distance calculations.


Features
✅ Raycasting Rendering: Uses the DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) algorithm to perform raycasting and render walls.
✅ Player Movement: Allows forward, backward, and rotational movement using keyboard inputs.
✅ Wall Collision Detection: Prevents the player from moving through walls by checking grid-based collision.
✅ Textured or Colored Walls: Different wall types are represented by colors (or could be extended to support textures).
✅ Dynamic Camera Rotation: Uses trigonometric rotation to change the player's direction.
